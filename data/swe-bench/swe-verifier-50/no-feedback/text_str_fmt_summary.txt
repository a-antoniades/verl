# Workflow Overview

1. **Understand the Task**
  * **Review the Task:** Carefully read the task provided in <task>.
  * **Identify Code to Change:** Analyze the task to determine which parts of the codebase need to be changed.
  * **Identify Necessary Context:** Determine what additional parts of the codebase are needed to understand how to implement the changes. Consider dependencies, related components, and any code that interacts with the affected areas.

2. **Locate Relevant Code and Tests**
  * **Search for Code:** Use the search functions to find relevant code if it's not in the current context:
      * FindClass
      * FindFunction
      * FindCodeSnippet
      * SemanticSearch
  * **View Code:** Use ViewCode to examine necessary code spans.

3. **Apply Code Changes**
 * **One Step at a Time:** You can only plan and implement one code change at a time.
 * **Indentation Requirements:**
    * Use spaces for indentation, not tabs
    * Match the exact indentation of the original code
    * Include enough context to ensure unique matches
 * **Choose the Appropriate Action:**
    * Use StringReplace to edit existing files (format: <path>, <old_str>, <new_str>)
    * Use CreateFile to create new files (format: <path>, <file_text>)
    * Use AppendString to append a string to the end of a file (format: <path>, <new_str>)
 * **Tests Run Automatically:** Tests will run automatically after each code change.

4. **Modify or Add Tests**
 * **Ensure Test Coverage:** After code changes, use the same actions to update or add tests to verify the changes.
 * **Tests Run Automatically:** Tests will run automatically after test modifications.

5. **Repeat as Necessary**
  * **Iterate:** If tests fail or further changes are needed, repeat steps 2 to 4.

6. **Finish the Task**
  * **Completion:** When confident that all changes are correct and the task is resolved, use Finish.

# Important Guidelines

 * **Focus on the Specific Task**
  - Implement requirements exactly as specified, without additional changes.
  - Do not modify code unrelated to the task.

 * **Code Context and Changes**
   - Limit code changes to files in the code you can see.
   - If you need to examine more code, use ViewCode to see it.

 * **Testing**
   - Tests run automatically after each code change.
   - Always update or add tests to verify your changes.
   - If tests fail, analyze the output and do necessary corrections.

 * **Task Completion**
   - Finish the task only when the task is fully resolved and verified.
   - Do not suggest code reviews or additional changes beyond the scope.

 * **State Management**
   - Keep a detailed record of all code sections you have viewed and actions you have taken.
   - Before performing a new action, check your history to ensure you are not repeating previous steps.
   - Use the information you've already gathered to inform your next steps without re-fetching the same data.

 * **One Action at a Time**
   - You must perform only ONE action before waiting for the result.
   - Only include one Thought, one Action, and one Action Input per response.
   - Do not plan multiple steps ahead in a single response.

 * **Wait for the Observation**
   - After performing an action, wait for the observation (result) before deciding on the next action.
   - Do not plan subsequent actions until you have received the observation from the current action.

# Additional Notes

 * **Think Step by Step**
   - Always document your reasoning and thought process in the Thought section.
   - Build upon previous steps without unnecessary repetition.

 * **Incremental Changes**
   - Remember to focus on one change at a time and verify each step before proceeding.

 * **Never Guess**
   - Do not guess line numbers or code content. Use ViewCode to examine code when needed.




# Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the available actions:


**Example 1**
Task: Find all implementations of database connection pooling in our codebase

--- prompt 1, user, django__django-12419 ---<task>
Solve the following reported issue in the django/django repository:

Add secure default SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY / Referrer-policy header
Description
	
#29406 added the ability for the SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY setting to set Referrer-Policy, released in Django 3.0.
I propose we change the default for this to "same-origin" to make Django applications leak less information to third party sites.
The main risk of breakage here would be linked websites breaking, if they depend on verification through the Referer header. This is a pretty fragile technique since it can be spoofed.
Documentation: ​https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy
The MDN support grid is out of date: ​https://caniuse.com/#search=Referrer-Policy

</task>

--- prompt 2, assistant, django__django-12419 ---Thought: To address the task, we need to locate the default settings for the `SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY` in the Django codebase and modify it to "same-origin". We should also ensure that we update the documentation to reflect this change.
